oczupsh - ActiveSync for Owncloud

!!! Not under Active developpement !!!
!!! You WILL loose information !!! (Perhaps acceptable)

Why ?:
- It is at "work for me" stage and I don't have many time to work on it
  Patches are accepted, but
- VCARD from/to ActiveSync conversion is not bijective
  the email type exemple :
     - VCARD supports more then 3 email address, AS don't
     - VCARD's email address can be qualified (HOME or WORK)
     - AS only have email1, email2, email3
  So if you have a contact with a HOME and WORK email, you'll loose this information
- With Android (VCARD based) and protocol based on MSActiveSync is a bad Idea
  VCARD <-> ActiveSync <-> VCARD
  There is two VCARD based product synced by AS protocol leads to big data mess.

OLD README:

Based on
- z-push 2.0.6 stable's svn version
   http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/z-push/release/2.0
- Owncloud's (should work on stable 4.5.x)
   http://owncloud.org/

What works :
- Contact sync
- Calendar sync
- Tasks untested (no UI on owncloud side)
- Tested with Android Emulator 2.3.3 and 4.0
- Reported to work on :
  - Samsung Galaxy S2
  - Iphone 4 and Ipad 2 (thanks a40a)
  - HTC runnyDroid ROM (Sense 3.5 + android 2.3.5)

Todo :
- Fix VCARD format to V3.0
- test tasks
- mail/imap from owncloud's conf
- Owncloud integration :
  - app
  - configuration
  - device management (wipe, lock, etc...)
- Multi folder (multi calendar/addressbook)
- What else, tell me :)

Quick Install, debian/ubuntu style (thks to AlainB) :
- checkout :
 cd /var/www ; git clone https://github.com/gza/oczpush.git

- php parameters (I prefer put it in apache conf) + Apache conf

Alias /Microsoft-Server-ActiveSync /var/www/oczpush/index.php
 <Directory "/var/www/oczpush/">
    php_flag magic_quotes_gpc off
    php_flag register_globals off
    php_flag magic_quotes_runtime off
    php_flag short_open_tag on
 </Directory>

- dirs
mkdir -p /var/log/oczpush/ /var/lib/oczpush/ /var/www/oczpush/
chown www-data:www-data /var/log/oczpush/ /var/lib/oczpush/ 

- edit /var/www/oczpush/config.php
NB: if you installed from debian package, this is probably '/usr/share/owncloud', otherwise, you know better than me :)
define('OC_DIR', '/var/www/owncloud');

- optional, if you know what you do, Upgrade z-push codebase :
z-push's .svn is integrated, svn up should work, but will probably prevent any git pull to work anymore
